# Brian's Brain cells automate

Programing with C on DevCpp

## Rules:

* Each cell has three possible states: passive, active, and semi-active.
* If a cell is active, it goes to semi-active state on the next step
* If a cell is semi-active, it becomes passive on the next step
* If a cell is passive, it becomes active if and only if it has exactly 2 active neighbors
